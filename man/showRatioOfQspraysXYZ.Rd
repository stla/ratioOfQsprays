\title{Print a 'ratioOfQsprays'}
\usage{
showRatioOfQspraysXYZ(
  letters = c("x", "y", "z"),
  quotientBar = "  \%//\%  ",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{letters}{a vector of strings, usually some letters such as \code{"x"}
and \code{"y"}, to denote the variables}

\item{quotientBar}{a string representing the quotient bar between the
numerator and the denominator, including surrounding spaces,
e.g \code{" / "}}

\item{...}{arguments other than \code{quotientBar} passed to
\code{\link{showRatioOfQsprays}}}
}
\value{
A function which takes as argument a \code{ratioOfQsprays} object
  and which prints it.
}
\description{
Print a \code{ratioOfQsprays} object given some letters to
  denote the variables, by printing monomials like \code{"x^2.yz"}.
}
\note{
The function returned by this function can be used as the option
  \code{"showRatioOfQsprays"} of the setter function
  \code{\link{showRatioOfQspraysOption<-}}.
  As another note, let us describe the behavior of this function in a
  case when the number of variables of the \code{ratioOfQsprays} object to
  be printed is bigger than the number of provided letters. In such a case,
  the output will be the same as an application of the function
  \code{showRatioOfQspraysX1X2X3(x)} with \code{x} being the first letter
  provided. See the example.

\examples{
set.seed(666)
( roq <- rRatioOfQsprays() )
showRatioOfQspraysXYZ(c("X", "Y", "Z"), " / ")(roq)
# now take a ratioOfQsprays with four variables:
roq <- roq * qlone(4)
# then the symbols X1, X2, X3, X4 denote the variables now:
showRatioOfQspraysXYZ(c("X", "Y", "Z"), " / ")(roq)
# this is the method used by default to print the ratioOfQsprays objects,
# with the initial letters x, y, z which then become x1, x2, x3, x4:
roq
