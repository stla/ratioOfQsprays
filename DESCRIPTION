Description: This package is based on the 'qspray' package and it
    introduces the new type 'ratioOfQsprays'. An object of type 'qspray' 
    represents a multivariate polynomial with rational coefficients. An 
    object of type 'ratioOfQsprays' is defined by two 'qspray' objects
    and represents a fraction of two multivariate polynomials with rational 
    coefficients. Arithmetic operations for these objects are available, 
    and they always automatically return irreducible fractions. Other features 
    include: differentiation, evaluation, conversion to a function, and fine 
    control of the way to print a 'ratioOfQsprays' object.
