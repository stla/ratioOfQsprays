Description: Based on the 'qspray' package, this package introduces the new 
    type 'ratioOfQsprays'. An object of type 'qspray' represents a multivariate 
    polynomial with rational coefficients while an object of type 
    'ratioOfQsprays', defined by two 'qspray' objects, represents a fraction of 
    two multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients. Arithmetic 
    operations for these objects are available, and they always return 
    irreducible fractions. Other features include: differentiation, 
    evaluation, conversion to a function, and fine control of the way to print 
    a 'ratioOfQsprays' object. The 'C++' library 'CGAL' is used to make the 
    fractions irreducible.
